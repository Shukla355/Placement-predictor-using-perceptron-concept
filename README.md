# Placement-predictor-using-perceptron-concept

A "Placement Predictor using the Perceptron Concept" is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a student or job candidate being placed in a particular position or company. Leveraging the foundational principles of perceptrons—a type of linear classifier that serves as a building block for neural networks—this tool intakes various features like academic scores, skills, or experience and outputs a binary classification: "placed" or "not placed". By training on past placement data, the predictor refines its weight parameters to make accurate future predictions, serving as a valuable resource for educational institutions and hiring professionals.
